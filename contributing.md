# How To Submit Your Coursework

Use Git & GitHub to submit your coursework as a pull request.

Follow the template when creating your pull request.

Make sure to follow the checklist, and fill in all questions (or remove unnecessary sections).

 Make sure to add the "Needs Review" label, or you won't get review.

## Questions & Help

Contributing to a remote codebase is a necessary skill for a professional developer. Opening PRs is mandatory at CYF. It is part of the coursework.

If you cannot submit your coursework you **must** post on Slack to get unblocked.

## Adding/editing exercises

If you want to add/edit exercises, please create a PR to this repo. You can ignore the template. You probably want to send a message in #cyf-curriculum on Slack to draw someone's attention to your edits.
